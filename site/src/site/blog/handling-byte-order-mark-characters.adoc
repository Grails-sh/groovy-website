:description: Handling Byte Order Mark (BOM) characters in Groovy

A https://www.javacodegeeks.com/remove-byte-order-mark-characters-from-file.html[recent article]
showed how to process https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byte_order_mark[Byte Order Mark (BOM)] characters
within text files when coding in Java. In particular, often manual removal of those characters might
be needed when processing text files. The article showed how to remove the BOM characters when using
the `InputStream` and `Reader` classes as well as how to do it using `NIO` functionality. It also showed
how the `BOMInputStream` class in https://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-io/[Apache Commons IO]
could be used. It automatically skips over the BOM characters.

Those examples can be run as is in Groovy (albeit after fixing a bug in the first example)
but the (complete!) idiomatic solution in Groovy is:

[source,groovy]
----
println new File('file.txt').text
----

That's right, Groovy automatically detects
the encoding, and removes BOM characters,
when using the `getText()` method
along with others like `eachLine`, `splitEachLine`,
`readLines`, `withReader`, and `filterLine`.
The same functionality can be obtained using
the `newReader` method too on files and URLs.

When needed there are variants that let you
specify the encoding should you wish to explicitly
declare it. In that case, you'd need to handle the
BOM characters manually.

Groovy's methods like `getText` call an underlying
`CharsetToolkit` class. You can also use that class directly
should you wish to learn more about the encoding
of a file.
